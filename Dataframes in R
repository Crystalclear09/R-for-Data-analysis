#GOAL : We will read into R a file that holds population figures for Australian states and territories, and total population, at various times since 1917, then using this file to create a graph. 
#The data in the file are stored in aust.csv
#The following reads in the data from the file aust.txt on a disk in drive c:

austpop <- read.table("C:/Rdatafiles/aust.txt", header=TRUE)

#Please note that 
#<- is a left diamond bracket (<) followed by a minus sign (-). It means “is assigned to”. 
#Use of header=TRUE causes R to use= the first line to get header information for the columns. 


names(austpop) 
# above command will give the column names
